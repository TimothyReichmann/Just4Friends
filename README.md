# Just4Friends
UI/UX prototype of a friend-finding mobile app

The report specifies how and why this app was developed.  The interactive PDF allows you to see the different screens of the prototype and the buttons, when clicked, will take you to the view they would take you to on a working app. Greg Niebanck and Chris Neilson were my primary team members for this project, Gurbir Behniwal and Xiaoyong Zheng were also on the team.
